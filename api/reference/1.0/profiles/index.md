# Profiles

A `Profile` represents a user of the Launch system. Launch does not maintain it's own database of users and permissions, it instead relies on Adobe IDs managed by Adobe's company-wide Identity Management System (IMS).

The `Profile` contains all the information about the logged in user, including all the Adobe Orgs to which they belong, the product profiles they belong to within each org, and the rights they have from each product profile.
